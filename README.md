# Sentiment-Analysis-in-Sentences

- ✔ Sentiments have become major part in our life. People are more concern about the sentiments in the texts or sentences in the message in social medias and everywhere.

- ✔ The objective of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model in R that can classify the sentiments expressed in sentences. 

- ✔ Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing (NLP), Text mining, and some methods to find the sentiments in the sentences that involves identifying and categorizing the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) conveyed in textual data.

- ✔ Also we used the NRC emotion lexicon is a list of English words and their associations with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive).

- ✔ The sentiment scores are found using certain methods like syuzhet, bing, afinn and nrc. But we use mostly syuzhet score for further score calculation.

- ✔ The sentiment score is calculated only after cleaning and transforming data’s according to what the model is needed.

- ✔ Bar plot and pie chart is been used to visualize various types of sentiments in group of sentences.
